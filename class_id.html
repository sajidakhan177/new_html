    <!-- <p>
        clases are used for defining property 
        clases can have duplicate name
        whatever written in classes can be called in elements
        if i call a class inside some element so what ever properties mentioned in that class 
        will be apllied on that elements(elements are tags like h1 p div tag etc...)
        syntax od defining class inside any tag 
        <span class="bagrndcolor" ></span>
        we apply multiple functionalities to a single tag
        we just need to do after calling one class put a space and mention another class name 
        syntax as follows for multiple class calling <span class="bagrndcolor allingment " ></span>
    </p>
<p> id are identifiers ,id has to be unique,duplicate id are not allowed
    id are used for when we want to apply a functionality on specific element we can call its id and we can apply
    so wherever that id is used that change will affect accordingly
    <span id="mainspan"     </span>

.(dot) is for class #(hash ) is id 
 create multiple element using ammet
 span.myclass1.myclass2.myclass3*4 +<tab> to print 4 similar element using ammet
